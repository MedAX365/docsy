## Operation Rules

This is used for calculating the operator doctors' fees.

---

### Same Incision



Various operations might be within the same incision. In that case, the price is calculated by the help of the function. In the 'Same Incs' section, you can select these operations and adjust the percantages of the prices of the operations, respectively. For example, you can specify the price of the first operation by 100% and second operation by 60%. You can apply the same mechanism to the following sections.

### Different Incision

Various operations might be within the different incisions at the same time. Like the previous section, you can select the operations and adjust percentages.

### Different Crew

Different crew might work on various operations in a single theatre. For example, while a patient is in a trauma, a operator doctor and assistant operate on a part of the body and other crew operate on the other part of the body. These are considered as different crew so you have to calculate the prices accordingly.

### Recurrence

Recurrence is the return of symptoms of a disease after a remission. If there is a recurrence, the price is raised. For example, a patient had an operation, and 5 years later, the patient is needed to be operated for the second time. The operation will be much harder and risky for the operator doctors. That's why, the price of the second operation is much higher than the first one.

### Revision

A revision surgery is a procedure to correct a previous operation that either failed to relieve pain from your initial condition or caused further internal complications due to a misdiagnosis, surgeon error, lack of fusion, infection, hardware malfunction, or lack of recovery following a previous surgery. For such cases, health institutes demand the half of the price or discounted price for the revision.

## Complication

Complications is defined as any deviation from the normal postoperative course. If there is a complication and the operator doctors have to re-operate the patient. Health institutes do not often demand any charge from such a patient.
