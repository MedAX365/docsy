# Price Lists

To create a new price list, you can use the 'Price Lists' session. You can define multiple price lists. Because tariffs that issued by government or doctors' union or insurrance company have a decisive role in prices. According to the tariffs, you can create your own price list, respectively. Then, you can determine which price list will be used by which hospital or clinic.

### Products

---

You can select the services(products) whose prices need to be adjusted for creating a price list.

By the help of table, you can select the reqired services. On the table, there are two columns named 'Price Code' and 'Price Name'. The codes and names will be displayed on the invoice or will be sent to insurrance company while the claim is processed. These columns could be vital, because you can use price codes and names issued by Health Ministry. In an other case, some insurrance companies still use the old price codes, and for that reason you need to specify the old codes in the 'Price Code' field.

The columns to the right of the price column show which price group the selected service belongs to.

### Current Prices

---

For each service per clinic and per doctor, you can create a new current price. You can specify effective date range. When the effective date is ended, you need to create a new price. Once you create a new price, the old one is not valid. But you can see the old price in the 'Prices' section below the 'Current Prices' section.

### Score List Type

---

While you create a new price list, you have to specify the list type. In the list type, you can see 'Score List Type' as an alternative. At this type, you can specify the facilities and effective dates. For each facility and effective date, you can specify a multiplier for the price list. So you can create a score list. Thanks to the multiplier, you can differentiate the prices depending on hospital type or city. Because the purchasing power of people can change according to the city they live in.
