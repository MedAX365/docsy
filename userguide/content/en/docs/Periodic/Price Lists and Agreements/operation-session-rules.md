## Operation Session Rules

For a session rule, the fees of the other medical staff responsible for an operation and operation expenses are calculated. Various operation staff could take place in a single theatre. In this section, you can create the session rules and specify staff group for a session and how much contribution of them has to set. Thus, for each staff, for each session, you can create contribution rate in surgery operation by entering the score, parameter type and value fields. So, your other operation staff fees are calculated according to the session rules. You can also apply the mechanism above to the 'Medical Gas' and 'Operation Room Usage'.
