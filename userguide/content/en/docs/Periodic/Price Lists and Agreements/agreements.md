#  **Aggreements**

Health agreement is an agreement that requires an insurer to pay some or all of a person's healthcare costs in exchange for a premium. More specifically, health insurance typically pays for medical, surgical, prescription drug, and sometimes dental expenses incurred by the insured.

The purpose of an insurance agreement is to create a legally binding contract between the insurance company and the insured. Within this agreement, the insured agrees to pay small periodic payments in exchange for a payout from the insurance company if the covered event specified in the agreement occurs.

In the 'Aggreement' session, you can create a new agreement. So you can specify the coverage of patients while admitting them. While creating a new agreement, you can determine the 'Insurance Type'. These are public, private insurance, employer, individual or supplemental. You can also determine the acitivity of the agreement by using 'Active' option.
