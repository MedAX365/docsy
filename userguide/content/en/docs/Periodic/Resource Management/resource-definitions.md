## Resource Definitions

This is the resource list of your company. The types of resources are person, equipment, room and bed. To specify a person as a resource, you have to open **Setup-Staff-Staff List**. Specify as yes for appointment in 'General'. To specify an equipment, room or bed as resource, you have to open **Setup-Facilities**. Click the check boxes of them in 'Equipment' and 'Rooms' in 'Service Units'. Once you make the instructions above, you can see that the resources are added to the list in 'Resource Definitions'.

In this section, you can create appointment relations for each resource. You have to specify appointment type and reference resource type. In addition, you can specify the exact time frames in 'Work Times'. In a specific date, you can assign exception time frame to a resource in 'Exception Times'. And in 'Non-working Times' you can specify the non-working time frame for each resource.
