## Cash Reconciliation

At the end of the shift, the cashier deposits the collections and delivers the legal forms issued to facility treasure, in 'Cash Reconciliation' you can see the all cashier transactions and approve the transactions. This session is processed compatibly with The Cashier Transactions' in 'Front Search'. For example, once the facility cashier approve a deposit. Cashier can see that the deposit has been approved on 'Cashier Transaction'.


You can see the columns called turnover, credit card, cash, cash diff, deposit, income balance, expense and balance. The turnover is the amount that leave from the day before. Cash diff means as that; if cashier delivers the money different from the amount calculated in the legal forms, the difference reflects as 'Cash Diff'.
