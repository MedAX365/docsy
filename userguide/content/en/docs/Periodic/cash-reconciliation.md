## Cash Reconciliation

At the end of the shift, the cashier deposits the collections and delivers the legal forms issued to facility treasure. In 'Cash Reconciliation' you can see the all cashier transactions and approve the transactions. This session is processed compatibly with 'Cashier Transactions' in 'Front Search'. For example, once the facility cashier approve a deposit, cashier can see that the deposit has been approved on 'Cashier Transaction'.


You can see the columns called turnover, credit card, cash, cash diff, deposit, income balance, expense and balance. The turnover is the amount that leaves from the day before. Cash diff means as that; if cashier delivers the money as different from the amount calculated in the legal form, the difference reflects as 'Cash Diff'.

After collecting all money delivered by cashiers and checking the legal forms, the facility cashier makes 'Close Cash' and approve the daily cash reconciliation.
