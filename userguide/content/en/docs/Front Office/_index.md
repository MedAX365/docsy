The receptionist in the front office of a hospital greet people when they enter and determine how he or she can help them. Larger hospitals will frequently have a separate registration department where people entering the hospital for treatment, whether it is emergency treatment or a scheduled procedure, can check in and provide their identifying information. Smaller hospitals might streamline this process right at the front desk and check patients in here. Providing directory assistance is another common task for someone who works in a hospital front office.
