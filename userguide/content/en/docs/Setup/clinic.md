# **Clinic**

### **Adjusting services for each clinic**

---

You can define clinics in the **Setup-Clinic** session. For each clinic and for each facility, you can specify what type of health service is provided in which facility you select on behalf of the clinic determined. For example, cardiology clinic exists in Bulawayo. Once you select clinic as cardiology and facility as Bulawayo, you can specify the services provided in the clinic such as outpatient, inpatient or procedure by clicking 'Yes'.

### **Assigning medical form to each clinic**

---

After you determine the available services in the clinics, you can also assign medical forms for each clinic or hospital. You can reach the brief explanations about medical form in **Setup-Medical Form-Medical Form Design**.

With the help of 'Medical Form Design', the medical forms can be created. So you can assign the forms to clinics and hospitals accordingly. When you create the new form, you can determine the medical form by populating the 'Medical Form Entity' field. You can also create an effective date which is the starting date of that the form is used.
