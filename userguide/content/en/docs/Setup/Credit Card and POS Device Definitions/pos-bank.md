## POS Bank

You can define the banks that your company works with and POS device accounts.
You can create the POS device accounts by linking your devices to the banks. Then you can see the active POS devices on 'POS Device Accounts' for each bank. You have to specify name of account, POS device and terminal number. You can also make account identification with the right currency for your POS device accounts.
