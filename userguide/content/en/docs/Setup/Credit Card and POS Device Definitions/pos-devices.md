## POS Devices

Inside the POS device, you can install multiple bank software into the device. In this section, you can define the POS devices that your company works with and POS device accounts.

You can create the POS device accounts by linking the banks identified to the devices. Then you can see the banks on 'POS Device Accounts' for each device. You have to specify name of account, bank name and terminal number. You can also make account identification with the right currency for your POS device accounts.

You can assign your devices to a personnel in **Setup-Staff-Staff List**.
