## Physician Request Templates

For each physician, you can create service groups(templates) under a specific medical meaning to use in case a patient needs multiple services. For example, you demand to create a blood panel template under laboratory medical meaning for a doctor named Julia Funderburk . In this section, you can make a service group by adding services such as blood group, cholestrol and HIV. Then, Julia Funderburk can easily assign the multiple services by using blood panel template to a patient.
