## Clinic Request Templates

For each clinic, you can create service groups(templates) under a specific medical meaning to use in case a patient needs multiple services. For example, you demand to create a blood panel template under laboratory medical meaning in General Surgery clinic. In this section, you can make a service group by adding services such as blood group, cholestrol and HIV. Then, the doctor works in General Surgery can easily assign the multiple services easily by using blood panel template to a patient.
