## Price Custom Rules

You can create price custom rule for the specific situations. For example, the MRI of the patient is taken and the insurance company pay its share for the service. The insurance company also might declare not to pay for the second MRI within 6 months. For such demands, you need to define price custom rules. To create a price custom rule, a piece of code has to be written in MedAX according to the requirement.

After creating your price custom rule, you can use the rule in a line rule in an agreement clause.
