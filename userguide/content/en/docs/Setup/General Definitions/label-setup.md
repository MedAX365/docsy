## Label Setup

This is the label system you can use. You can create a label by specifying printer type. Printer type is used for determining the appropriate print language.A print language is a set of commands that can be used to draw elements like text, shapes, barcodes and images, combine these elements, and finally print them. For example, ZPL is a print language used by many label printers.

To use visit label or patient label or laboratory label, you have to create the labels by entering the proper information accordingly. For example, you can select the patient labels you create in 'Patient Label' in ''Facilities' section. Then, while admitting a patient, the label is printed automatically.
